Is-My-Game-Lagging
==================

Searches Twitter posts to determine public consensus on whether a video game server is experiencing issues.

Purpose
=======

I find League of Legends to be a very fun game. I want to play it if lag does not pose a severe issue. So one day, I got bored and made this thing.

Things I Learned
================

Twitter APIs are hard
Python with HTML is hard

Progress
========

DONE! I just need a way to collect data for the neural network and add CSS to the webpage. I also need to upload my code to here.
